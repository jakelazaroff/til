# Add a global `.gitignore`

If you use git on a Mac, chances are you've accidentally committed a `.DS_Store` to a repo. I used to reflexively add `.DS_Store` to all my `.gitignore` files to avoid ever repeating that mistake.

But there's a better way! You can add a global `.gitignore` file to your global config with this command:

```bash
git config --global core.excludesFile '~/.gitignore'
```

The single quotes around `~/.gitignore` aren't strictly necessary; if you don't use them, the `~` will just get expanded into the absolute path to your home directory.

Under the hood, that command just adds this to your `~/.gitconfig`:

```
[core]
        excludesFile = ~/.gitignore
```

**Update:** You can now do this without modifying your `~/.gitconfig!`! Not sure when this was added, but the [git documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) now has this bullet point:

> Patterns which a user wants Git to ignore in all situations (e.g., backup or temporary files generated by the userâ€™s editor of choice) generally go into a file specified by `core.excludesFile` in the user's `~/.gitconfig`. Its default value is $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/ignore. If $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is either not set or empty, $HOME/.config/git/ignore is used instead.

Not sure what `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is, but it hasn't been set on any systems computers I've used. On macOS and other Unix-like systems, the default is `$HOME/.config/git/ignore`, aka `~/.config/git/ignore`. On Windows, that maps to `%USERPROFILE%\config\git\ignore`.
