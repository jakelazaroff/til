# Patch a node_modules dependency

If a library has a bug, there's an easier solution than forking the repo: pnpm will let you [patch a dependency in your `node_modules` folder](https://pnpm.io/cli/patch).

```sh
pnpm patch <package-name>
```

pnpm will generate a temporary folder (on macOS, it looks something like `/private/var/folders/mg/longstringofchars/T/otherlongstringofchars`). That folder contains the exact contents of the package's `node_modules`.

You can change anything you want. I added `"sideEffects": false` to the `package.json` of [lil-gui](https://github.com/georgealways/lil-gui) so esbuild could tree shake it out of production bundles, but changing code or type definitions will work just as well.

Once you've changed the file (or files!), run `pnpm patch-commit <temporary-folder-path>` and pnpm will generate a patch with your changes at `patches/package@version.patch` and modify your `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`. After those files are committed, pnpm will apply your changes every time you install your project's dependencies.
